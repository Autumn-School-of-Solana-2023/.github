# 📝 What can I expect during the course?

#### 1. 👋 **`Introduction to Solana and Blockchain + Task1`** 👋
- Proof of History, Sealevel and other Solana fundamentals. We will also go through a proper local development setup to get you started in this course.
#### 2. 🧡 **`Introduction to Rust + Task2`** 🧡 
- A gentle introduction to Rust programming language. Principles behind Rust and how they tie to Solana program development.
Introduction to Anchor development framework and how it helps developers and contributes to security of on-chain programs.
#### 3. 👩‍💻 **`Solana programming model I + Task3`** 👩‍💻 
- Let's start developing on-chain Solana programs using Anchor framework. You'll understand how programs store data and state on the Solana blockchain. We will go through all important core concepts of Solana development:
  - Accounts structure,
  - Program Derived Addresses,
  - Handling errors &
  - Cross-Program Invocations.
#### 4. 👩‍💻 **`Solana programming model II + Task4`** 👩‍💻
#### 5. 🐛 **`Best development practices and debugging`** 🐛
- Develop like a pro! In this lecture, we will show you some best development practices and give you tips and tricks to debug your programs so you can get up to speed quickly.
#### 6. 🌐 **`Front-end for Solana Programs + Assignment of the Big Boy Task`** 🌐
- Make your program alive! In this lecture, we will show how to implement a simple front-end for our Bank app using the official Solana scaffold.
#### 7. 🛡️ **`Security + Task6`** 🛡️ 
- Hackers away! This lecture will introduce common vulnerability issues in Solana programs, how they can be exploited and most importantly how you can avoid them.
#### 8. 🎓 **`Final Lecture aka Graduation`** 🎓
- In the final lecture, we will wrap up the Autumn School of Solana and showcase some of the best final projects.
#### 9. 🍖 **`Bonus: SPL Token Program & Gaming`** 🍖
- 💰 **`SPL Tokens`** 💰
  - The tokens are everywhere! In this lecture, we will show how to implement a simple program dealing with arbitrary SPL tokens.
- 🕹️ **`Gaming`** 🕹️
  - Gaming is fun! Our guest lecturer Jonas Hahn from Solana Foundation will show you how to implement a simple game on Solana using the Unity SDK.
